# Bond Challenge

## Coding Question

Write an interface for a data structure that can provide the moving average of the last N elements added, add elements to the structure and get access to the elements. Provide an efficient implementation of the interface for the data structure.

For your submission, please submit a PR to the `main` branch of this repository. 

### Minimum Requirements

1. Provide a separate interface (i.e. `interface`/`trait`) with documentation for the data structure
2. Provide an implementation for the interface
3. Provide any additional explanation about the interface and implementation in a README file.

### Solution
mov_avg.py is a simple straight forward program which accepts numeric values for the data structure and calculate moving average for N elements based on user input and access the elements from data structure based on user input
This Script uses LIST as data structure to store elements
This has three methods, one for adding values to list, one for calculating moving average and one for accessing the elements.
All methods require user input to function.
