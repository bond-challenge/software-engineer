Marcus Eberhardt Bond Coding Assessment.

Python approach to moving average.

main calculations are done in the get_moving_average procedure which uses 2 inputs which can be changed manually(right now) or are set up for future execution of the python script with parameters by utilizing the argparse library.
unfortunately hadn't had the time anymore to fully test it, but left the commented out code in there for your convenience.

procedure will return and print the moving average of the input into the commandline.

thanks for the opportunity, if you have any questions, please feel free to reach out
Marcus
